# Engine patch set

Patch order for the CX26.3 / Wine 11.0 Cyder007 engine:

1. `cyder-compatdb-runtime.patch`
2. `wine-11.1-rtlwalkframechain-null-function.patch`
3. `cyder-ntdll-frame-walk-page-fault-guard.patch`
4. `cyder-wineserver-sock-reselect-pseudo-fd.patch`
5. `cyder-wineserver-poll-slot-guard.patch`
6. `cyder-wineserver-exit-diagnostics.patch`

`wine-11.1-rtlwalkframechain-null-function.patch` is the minimal upstream
Wine 11.1–11.14 behavior backport: stop x86_64 frame walking when no runtime
function entry exists.

`cyder-ntdll-frame-walk-page-fault-guard.patch` is the narrowly scoped Cyder
addition for non-null but unreadable or concurrently invalidated unwind
metadata.

The two `cyder-wineserver-*` patches address a wineserver `abort()` that hangs
every client process in the prefix, observed as the game freezing while
entering a map:

    wineserver: server/fd.c:1665: set_fd_events: Assertion `poll_users[user] == fd' failed.

`cyder-wineserver-sock-reselect-pseudo-fd.patch` fixes the reachable cause.
An uninitialized socket still uses a pseudo-fd, whose `poll_index` is -1, so
`set_fd_events()` indexes `poll_users[-1]`. Upstream only guards the single
`sock_reselect_async()` call site; the ~30 remaining `sock_reselect()` callers
(including the `recv_socket`, `send_socket` and `socket_get_events` request
handlers) do not. Wine 2.0.1 still had an equivalent `sock->polling` guard
inside `sock_reselect()`; it was lost in the later socket rewrite.

`cyder-wineserver-poll-slot-guard.patch` is the containment layer: any stale or
missing poll slot reports one diagnostic line and skips instead of aborting.
This also covers the unrelated use-after-free path reported upstream in 2018
(<https://wine-devel.winehq.narkive.com/E13v3OXT>), which the sock.c fix cannot
address. Both are still unfixed in Wine 11.11 and have no Bugzilla entry.

`cyder-wineserver-exit-diagnostics.patch` is temporary diagnosis for silent
wineserver exits observed after the poll-slot work: SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP/SIGQUIT
handlers print `si_pid`/`si_uid` (and sender `path=` via `proc_pidpath` on
Apple), `main_loop` return dumps `active_users` and process counters, and the
stale-poll message is upgraded to `FATAL` with an immediate `fflush`. On
SIGSEGV (when core dumps are disabled) it logs `si_addr`/`si_code` plus a
`backtrace()` frame/symbol dump before abort. Every diagnostic line is also
appended to `$WINEPREFIX/cyder-wineserver-diag.log` (via `config_dir_fd`) so a
killed gzip capture pipe cannot erase the death reason. Non-SEGV behavior
otherwise stays non-aborting.

`obsolete/cyder-ntdll-frame-walk-guard.patch` is retained only to migrate an
incremental Cyder006 source tree. It is removed before the two replacement
patches are applied.

`cyder-steam-webhelper-compat.patch` is likewise retained only so the build can
remove the obsolete executable-specific patch before applying the generic
CompatDB runtime.

The frame-walk and wineserver patches are intentionally CX26-only. CX25 uses a
Wine 10 base and must not receive them without a separate source and ABI review.
